The **Fermentation Guthub** initiative was started by four women from **[CNM NUS]**(http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/cnm/). However, it would never happen without the **[Squat&Grow collective]**(http://www.facebook.com/events/774736155927468/), the **[ÄŒiqi Clan]**(http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204849504210785&set=a.10204849274325038.1073741829.1034523151&type=3&theater), the **[Edible Garden City Project]**(http://www.facebook.com/EdibleGardenCityProject?fref=ts) and **[Hackerspace.sg]**(http://hackerspace.sg/). Our first fermentation tinkering, as well as probably the whole urban revival of traditional fermentation practices, was greatly inspired by **[Sandor Katz]**(http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/) and his **[wild fermentation practices]**(http://www.wildfermentation.com/).
