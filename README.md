The Fermentation Guthub initiative was started by four women from [CNM NUS](http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/cnm/). However, it would never happen without the [Squat&Grow collective](http://www.facebook.com/events/774736155927468/), the [ÄŒiqi Clan](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14889513/10266261/55e06098-6a89-11e5-9342-ea5f8d61dc12.jpg), the [Edible Garden City Project](http://www.facebook.com/EdibleGardenCityProject?fref=ts) and [Hackerspace.sg](http://hackerspace.sg/). Our first fermentation tinkering, as well as probably the whole urban revival of traditional fermentation practices, was greatly inspired by [Sandor Katz](http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/) and his [wild fermentation practices](http://www.wildfermentation.com/).
